# Our Dataset and What it Contains
The dataset we have chosen is [MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020-2025](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-daily-ridership-data-beginning-2020) . This data was published by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York. The dataset contains information on systemwide daily ridership and traffic estimates across multiple modes of transportation (railways, buses, bridges, and tunnels). The collection of data begins January 1st 2020, while also providing data from the pre-pandemic date for comparison. The collection continues into December 31st 2024 with 1776 days worth of data. The MTA tracks the usage of transportation and traffic patterns to show changes pre pandemic, during the pandemic, and post pandemic. 

- There are 1,776 rows, each row corresponds to: a single day 
- There are 15 columns, each column represents a piece of information: 
1. date
2. subways: total estimated ridership
3. subways: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
4. busses: total estimated ridership
5. buses: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
6. LIRR: total estimated ridership
7. LIRR: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
8. metro-north: total estimated ridership
9. metro-north: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
10. access-a-ride: total scheduled trips
11. access-a-ride: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
12. bridges and tunnels: total traffic
13. bridges and tunnels: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
14. staten island railway: total estimated ridership
15. staten island railway: % of comparable pre-pandemic day
# 2 Questions and Why? 
Question 1: How did daily subway ridership change from 2020 to 2025?
- Why is this question important and interesting? The subway system is a freuqently traffic mode of transportation by new yorkers. As a result the change in ridership of the subway would be the best indicator of how citizen's commuting to work, shopping, etc. has improved and New York City is recovering from the pandemic. The results of this question can help city officials, transportation coordinators, and other government officials understand the length of a recovery if a major event were to happen like this again and the habits New York City citizens practice and how they can appeal to them such as what times of the year citizens use transportation more.
  
Question 2: Which MTA transportation mode recovered fastest compared to pre-pandemic levels?
