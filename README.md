# Our Dataset and What it Contains
The dataset we have chosen is [MTA Daily Ridership Data: 2020-2025](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/mta-daily-ridership-data-beginning-2020) . This data was published by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York. The dataset contains information on systemwide daily ridership and traffic estimates across multiple modes of transportation (railways, buses, brudges, and tunnels). The collection of data begins March 1, 2020, while also providing data from the pre-pandemic date for comparison. The collection continues into early 2025 with about 1500 days or more worth of data. The MTA tracks the usage of transportaion and traffic patterns to show changes pre pandemic, during the pandemic, and post pandemic. There are 1,776 rows, each row corresponds to [a single day]. There are 15 columns, each column represents a piece of information [date, subways: total estimated ridership, subways: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, busses: total estimated ridership, buses: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, LIRR: total estimated ridership, LIRR: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, metro-north: total estimated ridership, metro-north: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, access-a-ride: total scheduled trips, access-a-ride: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, bridges and tunnels: % of comparable pre-pandemic day, staten island railway: total estimated ridership, staten island railway: % of comparable pre-pandemic day].
